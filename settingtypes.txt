# setting is disabled, but they still deal damage to creatures.

# If enabled, the “flat” map generator generates a Classic Superflat world:
# Completely flat, 1 layer of grass blocks on top of 2 layers of dirt on
# top of a final layer of bedrock. No caves, trees or plants.
# Also, if enabled, the setting “mgflat_flags” is ignored.
# If disabled, Minetest's default flat map generator is used, that is, trees,
# caves, and a deeper underground can be generated.

# Note: This setting has no effect on existing worlds.

# One of four levels defining the difficulty of gameplay.

# Peaceful: no hostile mobs, excepting shulkers, hoglins, piglins, and
# the dragon spawn, and nor do spiders or endermen, while players
# rapidly regenerate health and do not experience hunger.  Mobs will
# not attack players, even in retaliation.  TNT ceases to inflict
# damage, and raids cannot be induced.
#
# Easy: mobs deal 0.5x their standard values plus one additional
# health point in damage.  Players experience hunger as usual, but
# starvation can only damage players to 10 hearts.  Cave spiders
# cannot inflict poison, nor can Withers the Wither effect.  Villagers
# are never converted into zombie villagers, and zombies and skeletons
# never spawn equipped with armor.
#
# Normal: mobs deal their standard amounts of damage, and villagers
# killed by zombies are liable, with a 50% chance, to transform into
# zombie villagers.  Vindicators are capable of breaking doors.
#
# Hard: mobs deal approximately 150% as much damage as on Normal.
# Starvation can kill, rather than merely reduce the player to half a
# heart.  Villagers killed by zombies are unconditionally resurrected
# as zombie villagers.  Chunks that have been inhabited for longer
# than a certain period may host randomly generated pillager patrols.
# In addition, there is an increased chance of a mob's spawning with
# armor or weapons.
