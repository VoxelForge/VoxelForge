## Virtual items

Virtual items are variants of already existing items that should be treated as completely different by the game.
Currently this only means that they show up in creative inventory as seperate items. A great exampe of this is 
`vlf_enchanting_book_enchanted` item, Which has different enchantments stored in metadata, and is listed in the creative
inventory as seperate items.

To add virtual items to an item. You have to define `_get_all_virtual_items` function in the item's definition.
The function takes no argument and should return a table with following format:

```lua
{
    "brew" =
    {
        -- virtual items which will show up in the "brew" category of creative inventory
        itemstring,
        itemstring,
        itemstring,
        itemstring,
    }
    "deco" =
    {
        -- virtual items which will show up in the "deco" category of creative inventory
        itemstring,
        itemstring,
        itemstring,
        itemstring,
    }
}
```
