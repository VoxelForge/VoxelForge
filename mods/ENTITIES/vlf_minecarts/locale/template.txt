Minecart=
Vehicle for fast travel on rails=
Minecarts can be used for a quick transportion on rails.=
Minecarts only ride on rails and always follow the tracks. At a T-junction with no straight way ahead, they turn left. The speed is affected by the rail type.=
You can place the minecart on rails. Right-click it to enter it. Punch it to get it moving.=
To obtain the minecart, punch it while holding down the sneak key.=
If it moves over a powered activator rail, you'll get ejected.=

Minecart with Chest=
Minecart with Furnace=
A minecart with furnace is a vehicle that travels on rails. It can propel itself with fuel.=
Place it on rails. If you give it some coal, the furnace will start burning for a long time and the minecart will be able to move itself. Punch it to get it moving.=
To obtain the minecart and furnace, punch them while holding down the sneak key.=
Minecart with Command Block=
Minecart with Hopper=
Minecart with TNT=
Can be ignited by tools or powered activator rail=
A minecart with TNT is an explosive vehicle that travels on rail.=
Place it on rails. Punch it to move it. The TNT is ignited with a flint and steel or when the minecart is on an powered activator rail.=
To obtain the minecart and TNT, punch them while holding down the sneak key. You can't do this if the TNT was ignited.=
Place them on the ground to build your railway, the rails will automatically connect to each other and will turn into curves, T-junctions, crossings and slopes as needed.=
Rail=
Track for minecarts=
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Normal rails slightly slow down minecarts due to friction.=
Powered Rail=
Speed up when powered, slow down when not powered=
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Powered rails are able to accelerate and brake minecarts.=
Without redstone power, the rail will brake minecarts. To make this rail accelerate minecarts, power it with redstone power.=
Activator Rail=
Activates minecarts when powered=
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. Activator rails are used to activate special minecarts.=
To make this rail activate minecarts, power it with redstone power and send a minecart over this piece of rail.=
Detector Rail=
Emits redstone power when a minecart is detected=
Rails can be used to build transport tracks for minecarts. A detector rail is able to detect a minecart above it and powers redstone mechanisms.=
To detect a minecart and provide redstone power, connect it to redstone trails or redstone mechanisms and send any minecart over the rail.=
