# vlf_mobs
This mod was originally based of off "mobs_redo" (https://notabug.org/TenPlus1/mobs_redo) by TenPlus1.
Heavily modified and adapted for mineclonia / vlf2 by several people.

## Registering mobs and mob definition

A new mob is registered using
`vlf_mobs.register_mob(name, mob_definition)`

This takes care of registering the mob entity using fields from the definition below.

Since commit PR#598 (mineclonia 0.90) these special rules apply to the fields used in the mob definition, before this no custom fields could be used in the mob definition!

All fields that correspond to a minetest object property e.g. collisionbox, will automatically be moved to the `initial_properties` sub-table to comply with minetest 5.8 deprecation.

Fields not mentioned in this document can also be added as custom fields for the luaentity.


### Mob definition table
```lua
{
	nametag = "name",
	-- contains the name which is shown above mob.

	type = "monster",
	-- holds the type of mob that inhabits your world e.g.
		--"animal" fights as specified by 'specific_attack', 'group_attack', 'passive', and 'retaliates'. Killing mobs of 'type' "animal" won't award XP.
		-- "monster" enables attacking players or npcs (depending on 'attack_npcs') on sight in addition to 'specific_attack' processing. This behaviour requires setting 'attack_type' and can be modified using 'passive' and 'docile_by_day'. Even child variants will fight and give loot. Mobs of 'type' "npc" will attack mobs of 'type' "monster" on sight. All mobs of 'type' "monster" can be completely disabled by server setting 'only_peaceful_mobs'. Killing a mob of 'type' "monster" awards "Monster Hunter" achievement.
		-- "npc"  can follow owner. Fights as specified by 'specific_attack', 'group_attack', 'passive', and 'retaliates'. Will additionally attack all mobs of 'type' "monster" on sight (this is not affected by 'passive', bug or feature?).

	persist_in_peaceful = false,
	-- Default is false for monsters and true for all other mobs. If false mob will immediately be removed in peaceful mode.

	armor = 100,
	-- entity armor groups (see lua_api.txt). If table, a list of armor groups like for entities. If number, set value of 'fleshy' armor group only. Note: The 'immortal=1' armor group will automatically be added since this mod handles health and damage manually. Default: 100 (mob will take full dmg from 'fleshy' hits)

	passive = false,
	--if true disables standard behaviour of attacking players (and npcs - depending on 'attack_npcs') on sight for mob 'type' "monster", disables processing of the 'specific_attack' table unless aggroed for all mobs, and even prevents retaliation against direct attacks unless overriden by 'retaliates'. 'group_attack' processing is not affected by 'passive' (bug or feature?).

	-- how many health points the mob does to a player or another mob when melee attacking.

	knock_back = false,
	-- when true has mobs falling backwards when hit, the greater the damage the more they move back.

	fear_height = 7,
	-- is how high a cliff or edge has to be before the mob stops walking, 0 to turn off height fear.

	fall_speed = -9.81,

### Mobs API functions
Every luaentity registered by vlf_mobs.register_mob has vlf_mobs.mob_class set as a metatable which, besides default values for fields in the luaentity provides a number of functions.

These functions can be called from the entity as well as overwritten on a per-mob basis.

"mob" refers to the luaentity of the mob in the following list:

 * mob:safe_remove()
	* removes the mob in the on_step allowing other functions to still run. It also extinguishes the mob if it is burning as to not leave behind flame entities.
 * mob:set_nametag(new_name)
	* sets the nametag of the mob
 * mob:set_properties(property_table)
	* works in the same way as mob.object:set_properties() would except that it will not set fields that are already set to the given value, potentially saving network bandwidth.
 * mob:check_timer(timer, interval)
	* This returns true if the timer identified by `timer` has reached 0 and resets it to interval, returns false otherwise. If the timer was never run before it is set to a random value < interval to avoid lots of timers firing simultaneously.

#### Breeding
 * mob:feed_tame(clicker, feed_count, breed, tame, notake)
 * mob:toggle_sit(clicker,p)

 * mob:attack_specific()
	* For all mobs: function to find specific things(mobs or players) to attack. Sets targets if found.
 * mob:attack_monsters()

	* Make the mob explode damaging players and entities and destroying nodes.
 * mob:safe_boom(pos, strength, no_remove)
	* Safe explosion that does not remove any nodes (when mobs_griefing is disabled)
 * mob:on_punch(hitter, tflp, tool_capabilities, dir)
	* Called when the mob is punched. Handles damage by default.

#### Custom Definition Functions

Along with the above mob registry settings we can also use custom functions to
enhance mob functionality and have them do many interesting things:

* `on_die`		 a function that is called when the mob is killed; the parameters are (self, pos). Return true to skip the builtin death animation and death effects
* `on_rightclick`its same as in minetest.register_entity()
* `on_blast`		is called when an explosion happens near mob when using TNT functions, parameters are (object, damage) and returns (do_damage, do_knockback, drops)
* `on_spawn`		is a custom function that runs on mob spawn with `self` as variable, return true at end of function to run only once.
* `after_activate` is a custom function that runs once mob has been activated with these paramaters (self, staticdata, def, dtime)
* `on_breed`		called when two similar mobs breed, paramaters are (parent1, parent2) objects, return false to stop child from being resized and owner/tamed flags and child textures being applied.Function itself must spawn new child mob.
* `on_grown`		is called when a child mob has grown up, only paramater is (self).
* `do_punch`		called when mob is punched with paramaters (self, hitter, time_from_last_punch, tool_capabilities, direction), return false to stop punch damage and knockback from taking place.
* `custom_attack`when set this function is called instead of the normal mob melee attack, parameters are (self, to_attack).
* `on_die`		 a function that is called when mob is killed (self, pos)
* `do_custom`	a custom function that is called every tick while mob is active and which has access to all of the self.* variables e.g. (self.health for health or self.standing_in for node status), return with `false` to skip remainder of mob API.
* `force_step`	a function that will run on every step before the player in range check is run

#### Internal Variables

The mob api also has some preset variables and functions that it will remember
for each mob.

* `self.health`		contains current health of mob (cannot exceed
						self.hp_max)
* `self.breath`		contains current breath of mob, if mob takes drowning
						damage at all (cannot exceed self.breath_max). Breath
						decreases by 1 each second while in a node with drowning
						damage and increases by 1 each second otherwise.
* `self.texture_list`contains list of all mob textures
* `self.child_texture` contains mob child texture when growing up
* `self.base_texture`contains current skin texture which was randomly
						selected from textures list
* `self.gotten`		this is used to track whether some special item has been
						gotten from the mob, for example, wool from sheep.
						Initialized as false, and the mob must set this value
						manually.
* `self.horny`		 when animal fed enough it is set to true and animal can
						breed with same animal
* `self.hornytimer`	background timer that controls breeding functions and
						mob childhood timings
* `self.child`		 used for when breeding animals have child, will use
						child_texture and be half size
* `self.owner`		 string used to set owner of npc mobs, typically used for
						dogs
* `self.order`		 set to "follow" or "stand" so that npc will follow owner
						or stand it`s ground
* `self.state`		 Current mob state.
						"stand": no movement (except turning around)
						"walk": walk or move around aimlessly
						"attack": chase and attack enemy
						"runaway": flee from target
						"flop": bounce around aimlessly
								(for swimming mobs that have stranded)
						"die": during death
* `self.nametag`		contains the name of the mob which it can show above


### Node Replacement
Mobs can look around for specific nodes as they walk and replace them to mimic
eating.

* `replace_what`	group of items to replace e.g.
				{"farming:wheat_8", "farming:carrot_8"}
				or you can use the specific options of what, with and
				y offset by using this instead:
				{
					{"group:grass", "air", 0},
					{"default:dirt_with_grass", "default:dirt", -1}
				}
* `replace_with`	replace with what e.g. "air" or in chickens case "mobs:egg"
* `replace_rate`	how random should the replace rate be (typically 10)
`replace_offset` +/- value to check specific node to replace

* `on_replace(self, pos, oldnode, newnode)`
	is called when mob is about to replace a node. Also called
	when not actually replacing due to mobs_griefing setting being false.
* `self`	ObjectRef of mob
* `pos`	 Position of node to replace
* `oldnode` Current node
* `newnode` What the node will become after replacing. If false is returned, the mob will not replace the node.	By default, replacing sets self.gotten to true and resets the object properties.

### Riding Mobs

Mobs can now be ridden by players and the following shows its functions and
usage:


`vlf_mobs.attach(self, player)`

This function attaches a player to the mob so it can be ridden.

 * 'self'	mob information
 * 'player' player information


`vlf_mobs.detach(player, offset)`

This function will detach the player currently riding a mob to an offset
position.

 * 'player' player information
 * 'offset' position table containing offset values


`mob:drive(move_animation, stand_animation, can_fly, dtime)`

This function allows an attached player to move the mob around and animate it at
same time.

 * 'self'			mob information
 * 'move_animation'string containing movement animation e.g. "walk"
 * 'stand_animation' string containing standing animation e.g. "stand"
 * 'can_fly'		 if true then jump and sneak controls will allow mob to fly up and down
 * 'dtime'			tick time used inside drive function

Note: animation names above are from the pre-defined animation lists inside mob
registry without extensions.

Certain variables need to be set before using the above functions:

 * 'self.v2'				toggle switch used to define below values for the first time
 * 'self.max_speed_forward' max speed mob can move forward
 * 'self.max_speed_reverse' max speed mob can move backwards
 * 'self.accel'			 acceleration speed
 * 'self.terrain_type'	integer containing terrain mob can walk on (1 = water, 2 or 3 = land)
 * 'self.driver_attach_at'position offset for attaching player to mob
 * 'self.driver_eye_offset' position offset for attached player view
 * 'self.driver_scale'	sets driver scale for mobs larger than {x=1, y=1}

## Spawning mobs
Mobs can be added to the natural spawn cycle using

`vlf_mobs.spawn_setup(spawn_definition)`

### Spawn Definition table
```lua
{
	name = "mobs_mc:mob",
	--name of the mob to be spawned

	dimension = "overworld",
	--dimension this spawn rule applies to; overworld | nether | end

	type_of_spawning = "ground",
	-- "ground", "water" or "lava"

	biomes = nil,
	--table of biome names this rule applies to

	biomes_except = nil,
	--apply to all biomes of the dimension except the ones in this table (exclusive with biomes)

	min_light = 0,
	--minimum light value this rule applies to

	max_light = 15,
	--maximum light value ..

	chance = 10000,
	--chance the mob is spawned, higher values make spawning more likely

	aoc = 5,
	--"active object count", don't spawn mob if this amount of other mobs is already in the area

	min_height = -30912,
	--minimum Y position this rule applies to

	max_height = 30927,
	--maximum Y position this rule applies to

	check_position = function(pos) end,
	--function to check the position the mob would spawn at, return false to deny spawning

	on_spawn = function(pos) end,
	--function that will be run when the mob successfully spawned
}
```

## Commands
* /spawn_mob mob_name - spawns a mob at the player position
* /spawncheck mob_name runs through the natural spawn checks to verify if a mob can spawn at the players position (and if not gives a reason why spawning was denied)
* /mobstats - gives some statistics about the currently active mobs and spawn attempts on the whole server
* /clearmobs [<all> | <nametagged> | <tamed>] [<range>] - a safer alternative to /clearobjects that only applies to loaded mobs
## Mob Eggs
	vlf_mobs.register_egg(mob, desc, background_color, overlay_color, addegg, no_creative)

 * 'name'		this is the name of your new mob to spawn e.g. "mob:sheep"
 * 'description' the name of the new egg you are creating e.g. "Spawn Sheep"
 * 'background_color' and 'overlay_color' define the colors for the texture displayed for the egg in inventory
 * 'addegg'	would you like an egg image in front of your texture (1 = yes, 0 = no)
 * 'no_creative' when set to true this stops spawn egg appearing in creative mode for destructive mobs like Dungeon Masters.

## Mob projectiles
Custom projectiles for mobs can be registered using
 * vlf_mobs.register_arrow(name, arrow_def)
 * vlf_mobs.get_arrow_damage_func(damage, damage_type, shooter_object)
 * 	Returns a damage function to be used in arrow hit functions.

### Arrow definition
#### Object Properties
	Object properties can be defined right in the definition table for compatibility reasons. Note that these will be rewritten to "initial_properties" in the final mob entity.

```lua
{
	visual = "cube",
	--Same is in minetest.register_entity()

	visual_size = { x = 1, y = 1},
	--Same is in minetest.register_entity()

	textures = {},
	--Same is in minetest.register_entity()

	velocity = 1,
	--The velocity of the arrow

	drop = "",
	-- If set to true any arrows hitting a node will drop as item

	hit_player = function(self, player) end,
	-- A function that is called when the arrow hits a player; this function should hurt the player, the parameters are (self, player)

	hit_mob = function(self, mob) end,
	-- A function that is called when the arrow hits a mob; this function should hurt the mob, the parameters are (self, mob)

	hit_object = function(self, object) end,
	--a function that is called when the arrow hits an object that is neither a player nor a mob. this function should hurt the object, the parameters are (self, object)

	hit_node = function(self, pos, node) end,
	a function that is called when the arrow hits a node, the parameters are (self, pos, node)

	tail = 0,
	-- When set to 1 adds a trail or tail to mob arrows

	tail_texture = "",
	-- Texture string used for above effect

	tail_size = 5,
	-- Has size for above texture (defaults to between 5 and 10)

	expire = 0.25,
	-- Contains float value for how long tail appears for (defaults to 0.25)

	homing = false,
	-- Wether arrow corrects it's trajectory when target is moving.

	glow = 0,
	-- Has value for how brightly tail glows 1 to 10 (default is 0 for no glow)

	rotate = 0,
	-- Integer value in degrees to rotate arrow

	on_step =  function(dtime) end,
	-- Is a custom function when arrow is active, nil for default.
}
```
## External Settings for "minetest.conf"

 * 'enable_damage'			if true monsters will attack players (default is true)
 * 'only_peaceful_mobs'	if true only animals will spawn in game (default is false)
 * 'vlf_damage_particles'	if true, damage effects appear when mob is hit (default is true)
 * 'mobs_spawn_protected'	if set to false then mobs will not spawn in protected areas (default is true)
 * 'mob_difficulty'		sets difficulty level (health and hit damage multiplied by this number), defaults to 1.0.
 * 'mob_spawn_chance'		multiplies chance of all mobs spawning and can be set to 0.5 to have mobs spawn more or 2.0 to spawn less. e.g.1 in 7000 * 0.5 = 1 in 3500 so better odds of spawning.
 * 'mobs_spawn'			 if false then mobs no longer spawn without spawner or spawn egg.
 * 'mobs_drop_items'		when false mobs no longer drop items when they die.
 * 'mobs_griefing'			when false mobs cannot break blocks when using either pathfinding level 2, replace functions or mobs:boom
