vlf_entity_invs
===============

Inventories for your entities. It's simple. Depend on vlf_entity_invs and register your entity like so:

* vlf_entity_invs.register_inv("entity:name","Title shown in formspec",inventory_size,disable_on_righclick)
	*If disable_on_righclick is true other mods can handle when to show the inventory themselves
	* The inventory size can be set dynamically by initializing it with an explicit nil

* vlf_entity_invs.show_inv_form(entity,clicker,[formspec text])
	* formspec_text is an additional text that is put after the title

It works by setting up a detached inventory per entity which is accessed by an id/hash generated from the entities position at creation, the progressed gametime at creation and a random salt.
