## Preamble
The Open Credit License (OCL) 2.3 is designed to allow free use, modification, and redistribution of software while ensuring the original author(s) receive proper credit. This version of the license enhances compatibility with other open-source licenses, including permissive licenses, and provides clearer guidance for commercial use.

 - D. "Redistribution" refers to any act of sharing, selling, publishing, sublicensing, or otherwise distributing the Software or Derivative Work.
 - E. "User-Facing Product" refers to any software, service, or application that directly interacts with end users and incorporates this Software.

### 2. Rights and Permissions

 - C. This license does not restrict the use of the Software in proprietary projects, and modifications to the Software may remain private if not distributed.
 - D. Any distribution, including within a larger project, must retain the Open Credit License (OCL) 2.3 for the portions of code originally under this license unless relicensed under an OSI-approved license. Users are not required to make the entire project subject to OCL 2.3 if combining it with other OSI-approved licenses.
 - E. Any use of the Software, whether in part or in whole, must include a copy of this license with a list specifying the files or folders that contain the licensed content.

### 3. Credit and Attribution Requirements
 - A. Any distribution of the Software, including modified or combined versions, should include an acknowledgment of the Original Author in the source code or documentation where practical.
 - B. If the Software is used in a User-Facing Product, the Original Author should be credited in an "About," "Credits," or similar section when feasible but not in a way that restricts use or distribution. For commercial products, attribution can be placed in accessible documentation or websites, and it is not required to appear directly in the product interface unless branding is impacted.
 - C. The Original Author's name, pseudonym, or project name should not be removed from any copyright notice within the Software unless explicitly permitted.
 - D. If significant modifications are made, the modifying party is encouraged to document the changes and include a notice indicating modifications were made.
 - E. Any public or commercial use of the Software should, where reasonable, include a notice stating that the Software includes components licensed under the Open Credit License (OCL) 2.3.

### 4. Compatibility with Other Licenses
 - A. The Software may be combined with or used within projects licensed under other open-source licenses, including GPL 3.0, Apache 2.0, MIT, and BSD. Redistribution under these other licenses is permitted, provided the attribution requirements of OCL 2.3 are maintained.
 - B. Any Derivative Work released under a different OSI-approved license must still provide credit in accordance with Section 3 of this license.
 - C. When redistributing Software alongside works under GPL 3.0, Apache 2.0, MIT, or BSD licenses, the OCL 2.3 terms must be explicitly referenced in the licensing documentation.
