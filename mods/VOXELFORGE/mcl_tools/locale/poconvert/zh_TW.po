msgid "An axe is your tool of choice to cut down trees, wood-based blocks and other blocks. Axes deal a lot of damage as well, but they are rather slow. Axes can be used to strip bark and hyphae from trunks. They can also be used to scrape blocks made of copper, reducing their oxidation stage or removing wax from waxed variants."
msgstr ""

msgid "To strip bark from trunks and hyphae, use the ax by right-clicking on them. To reduce an oxidation stage from a block made of copper or remove wax from waxed variants, right-click on them. Doors and trapdoors also require you to hold down the sneak key while using the axe."

This weapon has a cooldown of 1.6 seconds, but if you fall the mace will deal more damage than if you are on the ground. The further you fall the more damage done.
