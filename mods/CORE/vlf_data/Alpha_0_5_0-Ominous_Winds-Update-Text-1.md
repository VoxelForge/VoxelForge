# VoxelForge Alpha 0.5.0 Ominous Winds - Part 2

'birds chirping'

Ah, What a beautiful day, isn't it ? And what makes it even better is that it's Release Day! That's right. At last VoxelForge is getting a new update. And this one's a big one.
Now what is the one thing everyone seems to be wanting ? Giant wasps living inside the world attacking you everytime you log in ? Let's hope not. 

"Random Voice out in the distance" "An End Update". 

OOOh of course.. Well that's not happening this time, sorry. However to all of you wishing for an end update. Fear not, because this update still might catch your attention. 

The VoxelForge development team (that is crispiebacon and myself) has been hard at work over the past 5 weeks preparing to add some truly awesome features. Let's just say. We failed ...... Don't worry, I'm only kidding. We actually made some pretty good progress, and now VoxelForge has something that has never before been done (at least properly) in the mcl family. Procedural Structures. That's right VoxelForge can now have all those fancy buildings that everyone loves. Like the ancient city and trial chambers. But for now Let's dive in and see what all has changed since Alpha 0.3.2
