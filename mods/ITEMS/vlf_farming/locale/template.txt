Premature Beetroot Plant (Stage 3)=
Mature Beetroot Plant=
A mature beetroot plant is a farming plant which is ready to be harvested for a beetroot and some beetroot seeds. It won't grow any further.=

Golden Carrot=
A golden carrot is a precious food item which can be eaten. It is really, really filling!=
Turns block into farmland=
Hoes are essential tools for growing crops. They are used to create farmland in order to plant seeds on it. Hoes can also be used as very weak weapons in a pinch.=
Use the hoe on a cultivatable block (by rightclicking it) to turn it into farmland. Dirt, grass blocks and grass paths are cultivatable blocks. Using a hoe on coarse dirt turns it into dirt.=
Wood Hoe=
Uses: @1=
Stone Hoe=
Iron Hoe=
Golden Hoe=
Diamond Hoe=
Netherite Hoe=
Melon Seeds=
Grows into a melon stem which in turn grows melons. Chickens like melon seeds.=
Place the melon seeds on farmland (which can be created with a hoe) to plant a melon stem. Melon stems grow in sunlight and grow faster on hydrated farmland. When mature, the stem will attempt to grow a melon at the side. Rightclick an animal to feed it melon seeds.=
Melon=
A melon is a block which can be grown from melon stems, which in turn are grown from melon seeds. It can be harvested for melon slices.=
Premature Melon Stem=
Melon stems grow on farmland in 8 stages. On hydrated farmland, the growth is a bit quicker. Mature melon stems are able to grow melons.=
Premature Melon Stem (Stage @1)=
Mature Melon Stem=
A mature melon stem attempts to grow a melon at one of its four adjacent blocks. A melon can only grow on top of farmland, dirt, or a grass block. When a melon is next to a melon stem, the melon stem immediately bends and connects to the melon. While connected, a melon stem can't grow another melon. As soon all melons around the stem have been removed, it loses the connection and is ready to grow another melon.=
Melon Slice=
This is a food item which can be eaten.=
Premature Potato Plant=
Potato plants are plants which grow on farmland under sunlight in 8 stages, but only 4 stages can be visually told apart. On hydrated farmland, they grow a bit faster. They can be harvested at any time but will only yield a profit when mature.=
Premature Potato Plant (Stage @1)=

Pumpkin Seeds=
Grows into a pumpkin stem which in turn grows pumpkins. Chickens like pumpkin seeds.=
Place the pumpkin seeds on farmland (which can be created with a hoe) to plant a pumpkin stem. Pumpkin stems grow in sunlight and grow faster on hydrated farmland. When mature, the stem attempts to grow a pumpkin next to it. Rightclick an animal to feed it pumpkin seeds.=
Premature Pumpkin Stem=
Pumpkin stems grow on farmland in 8 stages. On hydrated farmland, the growth is a bit quicker. Mature pumpkin stems are able to grow pumpkins.=
Premature Pumpkin Stem (Stage @1)=
Mature Pumpkin Stem=
A mature pumpkin stem attempts to grow a pumpkin at one of its four adjacent blocks. A pumpkin can only grow on top of farmland, dirt or a grass block. When a pumpkin is next to a pumpkin stem, the pumpkin stem immediately bends and connects to the pumpkin. A connected pumpkin stem can't grow another pumpkin. As soon all pumpkins around the stem have been removed, it loses the connection and is ready to grow another pumpkin.=

A pumpkin pie is a tasty food item which can be eaten.=
Farmland=
Surface for crops=
Can become wet=
Farmland is used for farming, a necessary surface to plant crops. It is created when a hoe is used on dirt or a similar block. Plants are able to grow on farmland, but slowly. Farmland will become hydrated farmland (on which plants grow faster) when it rains or a water source is nearby. This block will turn back to dirt when a solid block appears above it or a piston arm extends above it.=
Hydrated Farmland=
Hydrated farmland is used in farming, this is where you can plant and grow some plants. It is created when farmland is under rain or near water. Without water, this block will dry out eventually. This block will turn back to dirt when a solid block appears above it or a piston arm extends above it.=
