# Mineclone2 New Ores and Deepslate
by NO11

This mod adds Deepslate to the Minetest game Mineclone2, which Minecraft adds in version 1.17.
Find new ores or build something from the 30 new blocks! Deepslate is generated directly above the lava layer in overworld.

Important: You need my "Mineclone2 Raw Ores" mod for this mod to work!
All other dependencies are automatically in the mineclone2 game.
Optionally use "Mineclone2 Copper" to get the deepslate copper ore as well.


You can find all craft recipes for deepslate blocks here: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Deepslate_(disambiguation)
(just click on the respective block)

Textures are from Pixel Perfection!
