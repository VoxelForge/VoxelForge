Pickaxes are mining tools to mine hard blocks, such as stone. A pickaxe can also be used as weapon, but it is rather inefficient.=鎬是開採硬方塊的工具，如石頭。鎬也可以作為武器使用，但它的效率很低。
An axe is your tool of choice to cut down trees, wood-based blocks and other blocks. Axes deal a lot of damage as well, but they are rather slow.=斧頭是您砍伐樹木，木質方塊等的首選工具。斧頭也造成很多傷害，但是速度很慢。
Swords are great in melee combat, as they are fast, deal high damage and can endure countless battles. Swords can also be used to cut down a few particular blocks, such as cobwebs.=劍在近戰中非常好，因為它們速度快，傷害高，可以經受無數次的戰鬥。劍也可以用來開採一些特殊的方塊，如蜘蛛網。
Shovels are tools for digging coarse blocks, such as dirt, sand and gravel. They can also be used to turn grass blocks to grass paths. Shovels can be used as weapons, but they are very weak.=鏟子是挖掘粗方塊的工具，如泥土、沙子和礫石。它們也可以用來把草塊變成草路。鏟子可以作為武器使用，但它們非常弱。
To turn a grass block into a grass path, hold the shovel in your hand, then use (rightclick) the top or side of a grass block. This only works when there's air above the grass block.=要把草塊變成草路，請用手握住鏟子，然後右擊草塊的頂部或側面。這只有在草塊上方的方塊是空氣時才有效。
Shears are tools to shear sheep and to mine a few block types. Shears are a special mining tool and can be used to obtain the original item from grass, leaves and similar blocks that require cutting.=剪刀是剪羊毛的工具，也是開採一些方塊的工具。剪子是一種特殊的開採工具，可以用來從草、樹葉等方塊中獲得原始物品。
To shear sheep or carve faceless pumpkins, use the “place” key on them. Faces can only be carved at the side of faceless pumpkins. Mining works as usual, but the drops are different for a few blocks.=要剪羊毛或雕刻南瓜，請在其上使用「放置」鍵。只能在南瓜側面雕刻臉部。開採照常進行，但是掉落物在部分方塊上是不同的。

You use your bare hand whenever you are not wielding any item. With your hand you can mine most blocks, but this is the slowest method and only the weakest blocks will yield their useful drop. The hand also deals minor damage by punching. Using the hand is often a last resort, as proper mining tools and weapons are much better.=只要你不揮舞任何物品，你就用你的手。用你的手可以開採大多數塊狀物，但這是最慢的方法，只有最弱的方塊才會產生有用的掉落物。手還可以通過打拳造成輕微的傷害。使用手往往是最後的手段，因為適當的採礦工具和武器要好得多。
When you are wielding an item which is not a mining tool or a weapon, it will behave as if it were the hand when you start mining or punching.=當你揮舞一個不是採礦工具或武器的物品時開始採礦或打拳時，它的行為就像手一樣。
In Creative Mode, the hand is able to break all blocks instantly.=在創造模式式下，手能夠立即打破所有方塊。
