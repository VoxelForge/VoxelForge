This mod adds a bed to Minetest which allows to skip the night.
To sleep, rightclick the bed.
Another feature is a controlled respawning. If you have slept in bed your respawn point is set to the beds location and you will respawn there after
death.

Use the vlf_playersSleepingPercentage setting to enable/disable night skipping or set a percentage of how many players need to sleep to skip the night.

vlf_beds.is_night([ time of day ]) - returns wether it's night with optional argument of a minetest time of day value between 0 and 1
