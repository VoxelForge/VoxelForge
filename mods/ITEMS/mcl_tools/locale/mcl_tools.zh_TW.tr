An axe is your tool of choice to cut down trees, wood-based blocks and other blocks. Axes deal a lot of damage as well, but they are rather slow. Axes can be used to strip bark and hyphae from trunks. They can also be used to scrape blocks made of copper, reducing their oxidation stage or removing wax from waxed variants.=
To strip bark from trunks and hyphae, use the ax by right-clicking on them. To reduce an oxidation stage from a block made of copper or remove wax from waxed variants, right-click on them. Doors and trapdoors also require you to hold down the sneak key while using the axe.=
Pickaxes are mining tools to mine hard blocks, such as stone. A pickaxe can also be used as weapon, but it is rather inefficient.=鎬是開採硬方塊的工具，如石頭。鎬也可以作為武器使用，但它的效率很低。
Shovels are tools for digging coarse blocks, such as dirt, sand and gravel. They can also be used to turn grass blocks to grass paths. Shovels can be used as weapons, but they are very weak.=鏟子是挖掘粗方塊的工具，如泥土、沙子和礫石。它們也可以用來把草塊變成草路。鏟子可以作為武器使用，但它們非常弱。
To turn a grass block into a grass path, hold the shovel in your hand, then use (rightclick) the top or side of a grass block. This only works when there's air above the grass block.=要把草塊變成草路，請用手握住鏟子，然後右擊草塊的頂部或側面。這只有在草塊上方的方塊是空氣時才有效。
Swords are great in melee combat, as they are fast, deal high damage and can endure countless battles. Swords can also be used to cut down a few particular blocks, such as cobwebs.=劍在近戰中非常好，因為它們速度快，傷害高，可以經受無數次的戰鬥。劍也可以用來開採一些特殊的方塊，如蜘蛛網。
Shears are tools to shear sheep and to mine a few block types. Shears are a special mining tool and can be used to obtain the original item from grass, leaves and similar blocks that require cutting.=剪刀是剪羊毛的工具，也是開採一些方塊的工具。剪子是一種特殊的開採工具，可以用來從草、樹葉等方塊中獲得原始物品。
To shear sheep or carve faceless pumpkins, use the “place” key on them. Faces can only be carved at the side of faceless pumpkins. Mining works as usual, but the drops are different for a few blocks.=要剪羊毛或雕刻南瓜，請在其上使用「放置」鍵。只能在南瓜側面雕刻臉部。開採照常進行，但是掉落物在部分方塊上是不同的。
Shears=剪刀
Solid Blocks of Steel. These are only forged if those that are brave enough can defeat the trials that await them.=
The mace is a slow melee weapon that deals incredible damage. “dig” key to use it. This weapon has a cooldown of 1.6 seconds, but if you fall the mace will deal more damage than if you are on the ground. The further you fall the more damage done. If you hit a mob or player then you will receive no fall damage, but beware. If you miss you will die. =
