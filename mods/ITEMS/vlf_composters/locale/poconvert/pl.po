msgid "Use organic items on the composter to fill it with layers of compost. Every time an item is put in the composter, there is a chance that the composter adds another layer of compost.  Some items have a bigger chance of adding an extra layer than other items.  After filling up with 7 layers of compost, the composter is full.  After a delay of approximately one second the composter becomes ready and bone meal can be retrieved from it. Right-clicking the composter takes out the bone meal empties the composter."
