Composters can convert various organic items into bonemeal.=Les composteurs peuvent convertir divers objets organiques en farine d'os.
Use organic items on the composter to fill it with layers of compost. Every time an item is put in the composter, there is a chance that the composter adds another layer of compost.  Some items have a bigger chance of adding an extra layer than other items.  After filling up with 7 layers of compost, the composter is full.  After a delay of approximately one second the composter becomes ready and bone meal can be retrieved from it. Right-clicking the composter takes out the bone meal empties the composter.=
