## vlf_itemframes
This mod has been rewritten from scratch for mineclonia. The old version was a
fork of the MTG itemframes mod heavily patched and added upon by vlf so that it
ultimately contained about 1000 lines of code.

With the rewrite it was possible to reduce this to less than 300 and add the
possibility to place itemframes horizontally as well as a clean API to define
custom item holding nodes.
