Blast Furnace=高爐
Smelts ores faster than furnace=冶煉礦石專用高速爐
Blast Furnaces smelt several items, mainly ores and armor, using a furnace fuel, but twice as fast as a normal furnace.=高爐只能冶煉礦物、熔掉盔甲等少數物品，但速度比普通熔爐快一倍。
Use the blast furnace to open the furnace menu.=使用高爐即可打開冶煉介面。
Place a furnace fuel in the lower slot and the source material in the upper slot.=燃料放在下方，要熔掉的東西放在上方。
The blast furnace will slowly use its fuel to smelt the item.=高爐會消耗燃料，漸漸熔掉目標物。
The result will be placed into the output slot at the right side.=冶煉成果會輸出到右邊的輸出槽。
Use the recipe book to see what ores you can smelt, what you can use as fuel and how long it will burn.=
