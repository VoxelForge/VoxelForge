Sign=告示牌
Can be written=可以写字
Signs can be written and come in two variants: Wall sign and sign on a sign post. Signs can be placed on the top and the sides of other blocks, but not below them.=
After placing the sign, you can write something on it. You have 4 lines of text with up to 15 characters for each line; anything beyond these limits is lost. Not all characters are supported. The text can not be changed once it has been written; you have to break and place the sign again. Can be colored and made to glow.=
