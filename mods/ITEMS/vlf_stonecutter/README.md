vlf_stonecutter
===============
Adds the stonecutter block. Used to cut stone like materials into stairs, slabs, etc. Also used as the Stone Mason Villager's jobsite.

### Adding recipes

* To add a new custom stonecutter recipe, use `vlf_stonecutter.register_recipe(input, output, count)`
* `input` must be a name of a registered item
* `output` must also be a name of a registered item
* `count` should be a number denoting output count, this defaults to 1 for `nil` and invalid values
    * a number with a fraction passed as count will be rounded down
* Stairs, slabs and walls get their recipes registered automatically
* Recipe chains are followed automatically, so any recipes taking `output` of another recipe as input will also be taking `input` of that recipe as their input

### Displaying the Stonecutter menu

* To display the stonecutter formspec to a player use `vlf_stonecutter.show_stonecutter_form(player)`
