Mob Spawner=生怪磚
Makes mobs appear=生成生物
A mob spawner regularily causes mobs to appear around it while a player is nearby. Some mob spawners are disabled while in light.=
If you have a spawn egg, you can use it to change the mob to spawn. Just place the item on the mob spawner. Player-set mob spawners always spawn mobs regardless of the light level.=當玩家在附近時，生怪磚會定期導致生物出現在其周圍。有些生怪磚在光照下會被禁用。
You need the “maphack” privilege to change the mob spawner.=
