msgid "Redstone comparators are multi-purpose redstone components."
msgstr ""

msgid "They can transmit a redstone signal, detect whether a block contains any items and compare multiple signals."
msgstr ""

msgid "A redstone comparator has 1 main input, 2 side inputs and 1 output. The output is in arrow direction, the main input is in the opposite direction. The other 2 sides are the side inputs."
msgstr ""

msgid "The main input can powered in 2 ways: First, it can be powered directly by redstone power like any other component. Second, it is powered if, and only if a container (like a chest) is placed in front of it and the container contains at least one item."
msgstr ""

msgid "The side inputs are only powered by normal redstone power. The redstone comparator can operate in two modes: Transmission mode and subtraction mode. It starts in transmission mode and the mode can be changed by using the block."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transmission mode:\n"
"The front torch is unlit and lowered. The output is powered if, and only if the main input is powered. The two side inputs are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid "Subtraction mode:\n"
"The front torch is lit. The output is powered if, and only if the main input is powered and none of the side inputs is powered."
