Command Block=
Executes server commands when powered by redstone power=
Command blocks are mighty redstone components which are able to alter reality itself. In other words, they cause the server to execute server commands when they are supplied with redstone power.=
Everyone can activate a command block and look at its commands, but not everyone can edit and place them.=
To view the commands in a command block, use it. To activate the command block, just supply it with redstone power. This will execute the commands once. To execute the commands again, turn the redstone power off and on again.=
To be able to place a command block and change the commands, you need to be in Creative Mode and must have the “maphack” privilege. A new command block does not have any commands and does nothing. Use the command block (in Creative Mode!) to edit its commands. Read the help entry “Advanced usage > Server Commands” to understand how commands work. Each line contains a single command. You enter them like you would in the console, but without the leading slash. The commands will be executed from top to bottom.=
All commands will be executed on behalf of the player who placed the command block, as if the player typed in the commands. This player is said to be the “commander” of the block.=
Command blocks support placeholders, insert one of these placeholders and they will be replaced by some other text:=
• “@@c”: commander of this command block=
• “@@n” or “@@p”: nearest player from the command block=
• “@@f” farthest player from the command block=
• “@@r”: random player currently in the world=
• “@@@@”: literal “@@” sign=
Example 1:@n    time 12000@nSets the game clock to 12:00=
Example 2:@n    give @@n vlf_core:apple 5@nGives the nearest player 5 apples=
