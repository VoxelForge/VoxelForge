End Portal=
Used to construct end portals=
An End portal teleports creatures and objects to the mysterious End dimension (and back!).=
Hop into the portal to teleport. Entering an End portal in the Overworld teleports you to a fixed position in the End dimension and creates a 5×5 obsidian platform at your destination. End portals in the End will lead back to your spawn point in the Overworld.=
End Portal Frame=
End portal frames are used in the construction of End portals. Each block has a socket for an eye of ender.=
NOTE: The End dimension is currently incomplete and might change in future versions.=
To create an End portal, you need 12 end portal frames and 12 eyes of ender. The end portal frames have to be arranged around a horizontal 3×3 area with each block facing inward. Any other arrangement will fail.=
Place an eye of ender into each block. The end portal appears in the middle after placing the final eye.=
Once placed, an eye of ender can not be taken back.=
End Portal Frame with Eye of Ender=
End Gateway Portal=
Used to construct end gateway portals=
An End gateway portal teleports creatures and objects to the outer End (and back!).=
Throw an ender pearl into the portal to teleport. Entering an Gateway portal near the Overworld teleports you to the outer End. At this destination another gateway portal will be constructed, which you can use to get back.=
Obsidian is also used as the frame of Nether portals.=
To open a Nether portal, place an upright frame of obsidian with a width of at least 4 blocks and a height of 5 blocks, leaving only air in the center. After placing this frame, light a fire in the obsidian frame. Nether portals only work in the Overworld and the Nether.=
Nether Portal=
A Nether portal teleports creatures and objects to the hot and dangerous Nether dimension (and back!). Enter at your own risk!=
Stand in the portal for a moment to activate the teleportation. Entering a Nether portal for the first time will also create a new portal in the other dimension. If a Nether portal has been built in the Nether, it will lead to the Overworld. A Nether portal is destroyed if the any of the obsidian which surrounds it is destroyed, or if it was caught in an explosion.=
