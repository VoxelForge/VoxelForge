# Advanced Tripwire System

## Description
The Advanced Tripwire System for Minetest offers a comprehensive solution for adding tripwire-based detection systems to your game. Use this module to create interactive environments, security alarms, or clever traps in your Minetest worlds.

## Features
- **Tripwire: Felt**: A subtle thread usable for connecting detectors.
- **Tripwire: Tripwire**: A detector that activates when entities pass through the connected thread.
- **Tripwire: Tripwire On**: An activated variant of the tripwire that interacts with the Mesecons system to send signals based on entity presence.
- **Entity Detector**: Effectively captures movement between two tripwires and activates signals accordingly.

## Installation
1. Download the module from ContentDB or clone this repository into your Minetest modules directory.
2. Enable the module from the Minetest interface.

## Usage
Set up tripwires in your Minetest world by placing tripwire nodes and connecting them with felt thread. Use the node settings to adjust their behavior to your needs.
